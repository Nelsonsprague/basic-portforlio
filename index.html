            <p> A little about me: </p>
            <p>I’m a developing coder who is passionate about being self reliant and active. I would eventually like to develop my own website/ap to educate people on places and ways to be more active outside. I am interested in learning as much as I can to develop a full stack skill set so I can fully realize the potential of my potential aps.  </p>

                <p>

                    I am currently enrolled in the University of Denver Coding Bootcamp which I will finish mid August and I’m sure I will be an asset to any company I become a part of upon my graduation.  
                    
                </p><p>

                    This is where I will post my ongoing portfolio, so be sure to check back often to see how it grows! Thanks for your time, I appreciate you looking.  </p>
